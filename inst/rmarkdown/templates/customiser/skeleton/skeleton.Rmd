title: "My .Rprofile"
knit: customiser::customiser
allow_overwrite: FALSE

This is a template file you can use to customise your R experience with 
the customiser package. The code that you include here will be transferred to
your .Rprofile when you 'knit'. Thereafter, the code you have included
will run automatically every time you start a new R session.

You can use a file like this one to personalise your R sessions to your own 
requirement or liking. For example, you can specify the amount of text that 
you would like the console output to print by default as follows.

```{r}
options(max.print = 40)
```

To be safe, code that you 'knit' using this file won't overwrite an existing 
.Rprofile file by default. If you always want to use this file as the source of
your .Rprofile code, then it makes sense to change the `allow_overwrite:` option
in the top YAML parameters to `TRUE`.
