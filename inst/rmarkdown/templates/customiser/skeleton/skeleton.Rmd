This is a template file you can use to customise your R experience with 
the customiser package. The code that you include here will be transferred to
your .Rprofile when you 'knit'. Thereafter, the code you have included below
will run automatically every time you start a new R session.

You can use a file like this one to personalise R sessions to your own 
requirement or liking. For example, you can specify the amount of text that 
you would like the console output to print by default as follows.

```{r}
options(max.print = 40)
```
