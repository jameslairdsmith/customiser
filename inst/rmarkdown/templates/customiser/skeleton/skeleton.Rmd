title: "My .Rprofile"
knit: customiser::customiser
allow_overwrite: FALSE

This is a template file you can use to customise your R experience with 
the customiser package. The code that you include here will be transferred to
your .Rprofile when you 'knit', and so this code will run automatically when 
you start a new session.

You can use a file like this one to personalise parts of R to your own 
requirement or liking. For example, you can specify the amount of text that 
you would like to print at default. 


```{r}
options(max.print = 40)
```
